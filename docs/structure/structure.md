# Introduction

These apps are what the users see on the controller and the main screens. They communicate between each other thanks to the bridge.

These apps used the same technologies :

React a Javascript frontend library
Typescript a strongly typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript
MUI a React Component library allowing for fast prototyping
Vite a frontend tooling library that configures our development environment
Socket.io to communicate with the bridge using WebSockets
